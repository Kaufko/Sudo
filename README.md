### FAQ
1. Do I need to re-download the installer every new update?
   No, the installer automatically takes the source code from github.
2. Is there any way to elevate the old cmd wihtout opening a new one?
  Yes, but that would require the Administrator user account to be enabled, which most computers have disabled, making this useless.
  I might make a 2nd version that utilizes that feature.
