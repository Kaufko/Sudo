# Sudo - Shell elevator

## Elevates your command prompt without changing current directory

### Automatic installation
1. Run installer.bat

### Manual installation
1. Download sudo.bat
2. Place in your desired location
3. Add folder to path

### Usage
1. sudo <command> - runs external elevated shell that runs command and prints output to starting shell
2. sudo /i - opens new elevated shell and closes the old one

### FAQ
#### 1. Do I need to re-download the installer every new update?
   1. No, the installer automatically takes the source code from GitHub.
#### 2. Is there any way to elevate the old shell without opening a new one?
   1. Yes, but that would require the Administrator user account to be enabled, which most computers have disabled, making this useless.
   2. I might make a 2nd version that utilizes that feature.
